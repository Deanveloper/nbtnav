# NBTNav
View NBT files within a terminal window.

Still under construction!

Use `nbtnav <file>` to view an nbt file!

## Commands
Once you have run `nbtnav <file>`, you will be given a command prompt. 
The command names in NBTNav are inspired by those found in batch and bash.

* `cd <compound>`: Moves into an NBT Compound
* `ls [compound]`: Lists all elements within the compound you are in, or the one that you supply
* `tree [compound]`: Similar to `ls`, but does a deep search, showing the entire tree
* `cat <tag>`: Displays the value at a given tag
* `exit`: Exits NBTNav

## Future Features
* Commands to manipulate NBT data
* Sort NBT tags in the order they appear in (not a necessary feature, but could possibly be useful somehow)
